# Who we are

## A brief history

In 1965, four years after Unitarian Universalist merger, the neighboring town of Ridgefield ran an advertisement in the local newspaper which brought out 25 people eager to start a UU congregation. In 1966, the Danbury and Ridgefield congregations voted to merge and were renamed the Unitarian Universalist Society of Northern Fairfield County.

In 1970, the merged congregation moved into an old barn and farmhouse in West Redding, Connecticut, which remained its home until the move back to Danbury 35 years later. With the final move came a new name: Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Danbury.

## At a critical juncture

Besides losing a minister, we have lost a number of our older active members, who have either retired, relocated or, sadly, passed away. At the same time we have welcomed many new families.

Although we are facing challenges, we are excited by the possibilities for change and growth.

## Who we are now

We may be small --- 136 members --- but we are proud of our congregation and committed to our UU values and principles. If there is one word to describe us it is engaged. We are engaged in

* our community through social action and volunteerism
* our congregation through committees, religious education and other activities
* our spiritual development through a deeper understanding of ourselves and our connection to the world

We are a talented group of people who love to have fun and spend time together.

## Who we are demographically

--- Mostly white (GALE INCLUDE STATS FROM SURVEY)

--- Highly educated (GALE INCLUDE STATS FROM SURVEY)

--- Aged 50 or older (GALE INCLUDE STATS FROM SURVEY)

## Seeking diversity

Like a lot of UU congregations, we would like to be more racially diverse. We are diverse in many other ways --- including having people who identify as LGBTQ --- which you will discover as you get to know us.

## Looking forward to the future

Team Green is working toward zero carbon emissions for our buildings. Other recent initiatives include looking into the possibility of offering sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.
