## **Could you be the one?**

### **Congregation at a crossroads**

We are at an important crossroads in our congregation, having lost some of our most active members while welcoming many new families. We seek a minister who will support us during a time of change and growth.

### **One quality above all**

Although professional competence, empathy, and character were ranked as the three most important considerations in screening ministerial candidates, there is one quality we seek above all: spiritual leadership. You must have a warm, charismatic personality and an inspiring style of ministry.

### **Connection is key**

We want a minister who can connect with us as a community, show us new paths for growth and change, and feed our minds and souls with sermons that are both intellectual and spiritual. A good sense of humor doesn't hurt either.

### **Get to know us**

We hope you will take the time to get to know all of us --- our children and seniors, our lay leaders and committee presidents, our LGBT members. We want a minister who is open and welcoming to new families.

### **A force for good**

We hope you will be engaged in and support our ongoing efforts in the wider community on issues of social justice, immigrant rights, racial inequality, the LGBTQ community and more. We seek a minister who will help us develop a stronger presence in the Danbury area as a beacon for UU values.

### **Work with us**

We want to interact with our minister in a variety of settings and on a variety of tasks, not just on Sunday mornings. Because of our strong lay leadership, you won't need to spend a great deal of time on administrative tasks, but you must work well with lay leaders and staff to keep UUCD running smoothly.

### **Growth and funding**

A successful ministry helps lead the congregation's financial support. We hope you will be enthusiastic about growth, comfortable talking about stewardship and provide a vision of UUCD that will inspire our congregation to give generously.

### **Care and compassion**

We are a caring and compassionate congregation with a very active Caring Circle and Knitting Ministry. We seek a minister who exhibits sensitivity and empathy for the pastoral work of the church. We want someone who is approachable and trustworthy with good interpersonal boundaries.

### **Let's have fun too**

We're not always engaged in serious work. We love to have fun and just enjoy being together, whether at meetings, services or social gatherings. Our annual auction always generates a lot of enthusiasm. We hope that, in addition to all of the qualities above, you will have a hearty sense of humor.

Read our Policy (LINK) for screening pre-candidates and for conducting a background check on our final candidate.

The Ministerial Agreement prepared by the Negotiating Committee will be sent separately to candidates.
