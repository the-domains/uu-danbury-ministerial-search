# Welcome from the Search Committee
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7fb00328-12b0-4be6-a573-6efdd734fed3.jpg)

Welcome!

We extend a warm welcome to you as you explore the information provided in our UUCD packet. In this packet you will learn more about our congregation and its hopes for a minister to partner with us in our spiritual journeys; also, its members, the surrounding areas in which they live, and our programs (those which operate within our congregation and those which extend to the greater Danbury community).

Having been given both the responsibility and the privilege of selecting our next settled minister, our team looks forward to deeper conversations with you. We hope that you will find that our congregation is wonderfully alive and committed to bringing our principles and values to the greater Danbury community.

Sincerely,

Maredith Spector

### Welcome to our fellowship hall among the trees

Once the decision was made to relocate the congregation to Danbury, construction began on our new home. The fellowship hall officially opened in November 2005\. A beautiful post and beam building, it features soaring ceilings and large windows which fill the hall with warmth and light. Looking out at the wooded landscape during Sunday services, one is filled with a sense of calm, reverence for nature, and an appreciation for each passing season.

LOOK FOR SELECTION OF PHOTOS OF THE FELLOWSHIP HALL, EITHER EMPTY OR DURING CONSTRUCTION, SOME OTHER PHOTOS FROM THE GROUNDS, CONGREGANTS OUTSIDE, ETC.

On the grounds, you will find the cottage, where we have offices and classrooms for RE. Surrounding the buildings and our recently expanded parking lot, you'll find beautiful plantings maintained by volunteer gardeners from the congregation and a lawn for open-air gatherings and children's play and exploration.
