# We Act

We believe in deed, not creeds. UUCD stands as a beacon for justice in the city of Danbury and beyond. We are actively engaged in the community through a variety of social justice issues, including immigrant rights, racial inequality, gun violence prevention, LGBTQ rights, support of our schools and soup kitchen and food pantry work.

We also walk the talk. In early 2017, we had 96 solar panels installed on the roof of the fellowship hall, making UUCD the city's first religious institution to go solar. One of our members just became the executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence. Another member is the writer and producer of the critically acclaimed documentary "Birthright: A War Story" about the war on women's health and human rights.
