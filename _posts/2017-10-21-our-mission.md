# Our Mission

At the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Danbury, we believe in deeds, not creeds. We care about the here and now and the future of our world more than the hereafter. We have diverse beliefs and backgrounds, but we come to gather in community, take care of each other, and celebrate life. We welcome you in the spirit of compassion, inquiry and service.
