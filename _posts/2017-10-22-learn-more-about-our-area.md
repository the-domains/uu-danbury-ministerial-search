# Welcome to Our Neighborhood

## The place we call home

Looking through the large windows of UU Danbury at the wooded landscape, one is reminded that we live in New England. The autumn is especially spectacular, with colors that draw visitors from all over during the season.

What makes us unique from other New England towns is our proximity to New York City. We are 60 miles away, and many area residents commute by car or rail for work. On weekends, that trend is reversed, as residents from New York City, all over Connecticut and beyond travel to the Greater Danbury area to visit our crown jewel --- Candlewood Lake.

The largest man-made lake in the state, Candlewood Lake has over 60 miles of shoreline that border four towns --- Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford and Sherman --- as well as the city of Danbury.

Each of the towns surrounding Danbury have their own unique character and history, while the city of Danbury is a vibrant cultural mix.

## Work, study, play

The Greater Danbury area is home to many businesses, a major hospital and Western Connecticut State University. It's also culturally rich, with places to see live music, theater, dance, art films and more. It's home to the Danbury Music Centre, Ives Concert Park, Ridgefield Playhouse and Daryl's House Club. Nearby are Caramoor, the Westport Country Playhouse, Pilobolus dance theater, Yale Repertory Theater and Tangelwood.
