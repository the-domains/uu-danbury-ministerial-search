# We Connect

### ...through worship

Our Sunday services reflect our UU values while drawing inspiration from many sources. They include hymns, readings, an offering, silent meditation and a sermon. Milestones, where we share our joys and sorrows, has an important place. Music and the arts play a major role, with occasional staged readings and services dedicated solely to music.

### ...through music and the arts

We are a small congregation, but our love for music and the arts is apparent. Members of the "piano ministry" volunteer to play for Sunday services. Our chorus of TK members, led by one of our members, performs once or twice a month. There are performances by various other instrumental and vocal groups, largely from our own congregation.

Our members include actors, a theater director, a filmmaker, artists, photographers and more. We stage plays and readings --- many with a social justice theme. The children perform in the annual Christmas pageant every Christmas Eve. Our annual Arts Sunday service features music, poetry and fine art by members and friends. Our annual auction often includes music and other performances. This year, we are bringing back by popular demand, Broadway's Next Hit Musical.

Check out our on-line auction:

Our performances make news ([http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Prop-8-play-comes-to-Stamford-4554166.php][0])

### ...through learning

Our religious education program is one of cornerstones of our congregation and the reason new families come and stay. We currently have 37 families and 66 children registered. On any given Sunday, there are 11 adult volunteers assisting with RE.
