# Welcome from Our Minister

Dear Colleague,

If you are perusing the packet of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Danbury then I will assume that something in the congregational profile piqued your interest and curiosity. If that is the case, then you would find yourself in good company with this lively and caring Congregation.

My arrival in August 2016 was met with some lingering sadness at the unexpected departure of The Rev. Barbara Fast who had been the minister here since 2010\. Still, the leadership was prepared to move forward to build on the healthy ministry Barbara had encouraged.

I continue to be impressed by the strong spirit and passion of this Congregation, particularly with regard to social action. At least two-thirds of the Congregation participates in a myriad of programs to serve the needs of the Danbury community. This is a Congregation that believes in walking its talk by supporting the Food Pantry, serving meals at the Soup Kitchen, volunteering for overnights at the Shelter, and mentoring students in the local schools. The Congregation is in the process of educating itself about the commitment involved in offering sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.

Care and compassion mark the relationships of the members toward each other as well. With three significant deaths during my tenure, I've witnessed the ways in which they come together to support the families of the deceased members, even as they mourn their own loss of dear friends. Between the Caring Circle and the Knitting Ministry, no one in need want for attention.

But they also have a hearty sense of fun and just enjoy being together, whether at meetings, services, or social gatherings. The annual Auction generates a lot of enthusiasm in addition to being the primary fundraiser for the year. The Auction items for which people bid then constitute a significant portion of the social life for the Congregation throughout the year.

This Congregation has a history of strong lay leadership, sometimes in the absence of clergy. As a result, there is an ardent loyalty to the Congregation and each other that exists even without professional ministry. What members look for in a minister is spiritual leadership for its work in the community and inspiring Sunday services. Although there is little institutional appreciation for the almost 200-year presence of Universalism in Danbury, I believe the Congregation's history is what grounds its commitment to the community.

The transition in which UU Danbury finds itself now goes beyond a change in professional leadership. There is also a shift in the membership as more of the long-term members move away to retirement homes or become less active in the day-to-day life of the Congregation. This has necessitated the examination of organizational structures and expectations, many of which have been passed down from one generation to the next, simply because "that's the way we've always done things." To their credit, the leaders are participating fully in assessing where they have been, who they are now, and what they would like to become.

UU Danbury would benefit from a strong and compassionate minister -- with a healthy sense of humor -- who preaches well and can appreciate the many strengths of this congregation. If you are someone whose vision of ministry embraces a collegial relationship with lay leaders, and you have a clear sense of your own identity and limits, then I hope you will give UUCD thoughtful consideration. You may be just the minister the Congregation is seeking. And you would find a congregation eager to move into the future with you.

My best wishes to you in your search. Please contact me if I can assist you in any way.

Yours in faith,

Nancy O. Arnold,

Interim Minister
